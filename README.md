===========

Source code for my Ludum Dare 30 entry - MARS COMMUNICATION SIMULATOR 2k14. I started the game with the idea that you have one person on mars and one person on earth - somehow they have to coordinate to solve a puzzle. The idea ended up being pretty boring, so I added some excitement about 24 hours into the competition. I don't think I'll turn this into an actual game, but it was a fun experiment!


Game summary
------------

This game comes PACKED with action, adventure and gameplay rivaling the CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED E.T. for Atari. This has more story that the back of a taco bell HOT SAUCE packet, more ACTION than your last friday night sitting at home watching TV. More ADVENTURE than indiana jones puppy at daycare! Don't pass up on this great game.

This game is ON SALE NOW for the amazing price of ABSOLUTELY FREE. If you ever dreamed of changing the WORLD, you should play this game.
